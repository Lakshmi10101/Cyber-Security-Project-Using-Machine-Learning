Cybersecurity has become an increasingly critical concern in the digital age, with malicious
actors constantly seeking new avenues to exploit vulnerabilities and compromise sensitive
information. Among the myriad threats, malicious PDF files have emerged as a potent vector for
cyber attacks, necessitating the development of robust and efficient tools for their detection. In
response to this challenge, our project focuses on leveraging the power of machine learning
(ML) to predict the maliciousness of PDF files.

The objective of this endeavor is to construct a sophisticated ML model capable of discerning
between benign and malicious PDF files. Our dataset, comprising 5000 known benign and 5000
known malicious PDF files, forms the foundation for training and evaluating the model. Through
the extraction of pertinent features inherent in PDFs and the utilization of ML algorithms, we aim
to create a model characterized by a low false positive rate and a high detection rate. By doing
so, we contribute to the ongoing efforts to fortify cybersecurity defenses against the evolving
landscape of digital threats.
